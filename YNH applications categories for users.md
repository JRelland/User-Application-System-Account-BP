This document has been written about the way to categorize the YNH applications in the installation page: https://bacasable.eu/yunohost/admin/#/apps/install.
Instead of having a categorization from the "tester and coder" point of view, a user point of view is proposed.


# Apps categories with 3.6.4.6 (stable) version
At the time I wrote this note, YunoHost is in this version: 3.6.4.6 (stable).

The apps categories are:
- Only high-quality apps
- Only decent quality apps
- Only working apps
- All apps

This is very interesting categorization from the "tester and coder" point of view.
From the user who is looking for a dedicated application, for instance "for reading its emails", it not useful.
This user needs to know the name of the application and to get it from the search tool. And in this situation, if it does not know another email application provided by YNH, he will not see it.

So the point is to propose a categorization which will be recognized by the user (even if he knows the name of the applications) and he will have the opportunity to all the applications available.

# Example of categorization for user: Framasoft

List in French (my translation which does not reflect necessary the author translation):

- Métiers (Jobs, or often Productivity) Note: except Office
- CMS (Content Management system, e.g. WordPress)
- Bureautique (Office)
- Cloud/webApps 
- Création (Creation)
- Développement (Coding)
- Éducation (Education)
- Internet 
- Jeux (Games)
- Multimédia (Multimedia)
- Science 
- Sécurité (Security)
- Système (System)

Note. Framasoft provides a categorization by "alternatives to". 

Sometimes, it is quite difficult to find a category for an application. For instance, NextCloud which manages files, user, calendar...)

A categorization in the YUNOHOST web page
In the "YUNOHOST for non-profit organization" web page, there is a very light categorization.
See this page : https://yunohost.org/#/use_case_non-profit_organisations_en

# Conclusion and next step
The categorization from the user point of view should implemented in the YNH 3.6 by the end of the 2019 year.
The Framasoft categorization seems pertinent and should be used in order to make YNH categorize with Framasoft practice which is a well-know reference (in France).

This point has been discussed during the YNH Camp 2019.
